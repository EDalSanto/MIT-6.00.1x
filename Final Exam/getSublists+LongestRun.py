Write a function called getSublists, which takes as parameters a list of integers named L 
and an integer named n.

assume L is not empty
assume 0 < n <= len(L)
This function returns a list of all possible sublists in L of length n without skipping 
elements in L. The sublists in the returned list should be ordered in the way they appear 
in L, with those sublists starting from a smaller index being at the front of the list.

Example 1, if L = [10, 4, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7, 2] and n = 4 then your function should 
return the list [[10, 4, 6, 8], [4, 6, 8, 3], [6, 8, 3, 4], [8, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 7], 
[4, 5, 7, 7], [5, 7, 7, 2]]

Example 2, if L = [1, 1, 1, 1, 4] and n = 2 then your function should return the list 
[[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 4]]

	return list_of_sublists

"""
Write a function called longestRun, which takes as a parameter a list of integers named L 
(assume L is not empty). This function returns the length of the longest run of 
monotonically increasing numbers occurring in L. A run of monotonically increasing 
numbers means that a number at position k+1 in the sequence is either greater than or 
equal to the number at position k in the sequence.

For example, if L = [10, 4, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7, 2] then your function should return the 
value 5 because the longest run of monotonically increasing integers 
in L is [3, 4, 5, 7, 7].

My function creates a list of sublists for i ranging from the length of the list L 
down to 0.
It then loops through those lists and checks to see if any of those lists are monotonic.
If so, the function returns the current value of i.
